        "Pizza Panic!" is a third-year group film produced at Sheridan College
        that has been nominated for best student film at the 2020 Ottawa
        International Animation Festival. The film tells the story of a botched
        demon summoning and the ensuing hijinks. As design supervisor, I was
        responsible for keeping the production and style of the fun-pack on
        track and ready for film production. I and ten other students were
        responsible for the production of rough and clean animation, layout,
        background painting, and compositing.{" "}
